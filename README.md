##1- Introduction to Network Analysis With R:
This script goes through the different network structures, how to load in and read through network data, and how to do some basic descriptive statistics (including graphing).

##2- Centrality
This script goes through how to measure centrality in multiple different ways, and what some of the measures mean - and plotting based upon centrality measures.

##3- Nodes
Includes properties on nodes, structural equivilance, roles, and positions.

##4- Diad/Triad
This includes calculations and interpretations of diads and triads and when they might be useful in calculations (a lead in to community detection).

##5- Community
This includes assortativity and community structure detection and graphing.

##6- Models
This lecture only briefly covers basic network modeling and statistical interpretation.
